# Pulse-level VQE
Standard gate-based VQE is limited by current hardware, where ansatzes of only a hundred or so gates can run up against the coherence times of NISQ devices. We propose to implement and extend recent theoretical work on optimizing pulses rather than gates during the VQE routine, which should dramatically reduce the time required to prepare molecular ground states.
